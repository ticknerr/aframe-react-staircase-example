# aframe-react-staircase-example
This aims to be a simple test of AFrameJS with ReactJS, to build a staircase with the Australian building guidelines in mind.
The UX is pretty terrible, I'd love to see what someone else would do to actually make something like this look nice and feel good to use.
Keep in mind that you'll need a http-server otherwise AFrame won't load the textures, I just use http-server which you can install with npm.
